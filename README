Temperature is usually measured either in Fahrenheit (°F) or Celsius (°C). These two units are related as follows:

	[°F] = [°C] × 9/5 + 32

The scientific unit for measuring temperature is Kelvin (K), which is related to Celsius as follows:

	[K] = [°C] + 273.15

Write a Java class Temperature that provides the following API:

	{SEE CODE}

Complete the above code to implement the missing functions. The public interface of the class must be as specified above. You may add any additional private or protected methods.
See this article [http://www.technofundo.com/tech/java/equalhash.html] for details on how to consistently override equals() and hashCode() functions.

1. Create a private repository called temperature on Github. Add adityam and ktsianos as collaborators.
2. Add your submission for the first assignment to this git repository. Tag your submitted version as assignment-1 using

	git tag assignment-1

3. Develop test data for unit testing the Temperature class that you wrote in Assignment 1. You must test the following:

3.1. Check the getUnits() and getValue() functions.

3.2. Check the changeUnits() function for all six possible conversions between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin.

3.3. Check that the equals() function is working correctly. In particular, check that calling the equals() function does not change the return value of getUnits() function. Check for all possible combinations.
Explain your reasoning for choosing the particular test data. Note that you may have to choose multiple test data for each of the above test cases.

4. Complete the following skeleton file TemperatureTest.java to unit test the Temperature class.

5. Note that if while running the above test cases you find bugs in your earlier code, you are allowed to modify the Temperature class appropriately.

6. Tag your final code with tag assignment-2 and submit the Git URL of your repository. The instructor and the TA should be able to

	git clone URL

to pull your repository.
